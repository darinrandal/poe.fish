# What does fishing look like in non-fishing games?
There are two common ways fishing is implemented into non-fishing video games.
- Interactivity with the Environment. Fishing rods are normal pieces of equipment in the game.  There are fish shadows in the water and you can cast into the water at any point.  There are no changes to the user interface or controls.  As the player, you watch the bobber on the water surface and press the appropriate button when you think a fish is on the hook. (e.g. Dark Cloud, Animal Crossing)
- Dedicated Mini-Game. The character needs to be in a specific location and initiate the mini-game.  Fishing usually has a set user interface and specific controls.  Often including elements; line strength, distance, water current, tension, etc.  These mini-games can also be represented through quick time events.  Once you meet the criteria the fish is caught. (e.g. Zelda, Torchlight, Breath of Fire, Stardew Valley)
 
# What does fishing look like in Path of Exile?
In spite of of our best research and observations, no one has provided a definitive answer.  In addition to the above implementations of fishing, there are two Path of Exile specific theories.
- Vendor/Item Combination:  A fish item could be returned from a vendor if the correct combination of items is sold.  A mini-game or environment interaction becomes available is a specific set of gear is worn or carried on the player character.
- Forsaken Masters:  Krillson, Master Fisherman is one of the Forsaken masters providing quests to exile who meet him in the wild.  After successful completion of his quest, a fish could be offered as a reward.
 
# How do I find a Fishing Rod in Path of Exile?
There are three 'kinds' of fishing rods; Base item, Song of the Sirens, and Reefbane.
Base Item, Fishing Rod:  Equip the unique helm, Fairgraves Tricorne and defeat unique monsters.  The fishing rod has a low spawn rate, so it might take some time for one to drop.  (The exception to this rule is the 'Perandus Tackle Box' which has a set drop table of a Fishing Rod, Slitherpinch, Fairgraves' Tricorne, and an Albino Rhoa Feather.)
- Unique, Song of the Sirens:  This unique item has been observed dropping from the boss of the Coward’s Trial unique map.  Song of the Sirens is also obtainable from Cadiro Perandus, divination cards, and using a chance orb on the base item.  There have been no verified reports of SotS dropping from other monsters.
 - Unique, Reefbane:  No drop restrictions.  It is just a unique item with very high rarity.
 
# How do I use a Fishing Rod?
A fishing rod can be used as a two handed weapon; however, there is a limited number of applicable attack skills.  Frenzy and elemental hit are the two most common builds seen using the fishing rod as a weapon.  The fishing rod is also needed to initiate the Krillson questline.  Other uses are still being tested.
 
# What is a 'Fish' in Path of Exile?
Unknown.  Some say a fish is the reward for completing a Krillson Quest.  Some say fish are skill gems.  Some say fish are a temporary bonus to exiles.  Some say exiles are the fish caught in Grinding Gear Games’ trawling net.

# Krillson, Master Fisherman
All questions related to Krillson, Master Fisherman, can be found on the [Krillson](/zones/krillson-master-fisherman) page.

# How do I find the Angler's Plait, Unset Ring?
All our current knowledge of Angler's Plait is found on the [Angler's Plait](/fishing-items/anglers-plait) page.

# What are the in-game fishing items and elements?
Check out the current list of confirmed and speculative fishing items [here](/fishing-items).

# Wait, I thought all divination cards are created by exiles?
True; to our knowledge all divination cards are still being created by exiles.  Grinding Gear Games still provides the final say on the drop restrictions for the cards.  GGG finalize any of the items on the pull list for the card outcomes; therefore, they approved the items in the Baited Expectations results pool.

# Where can I find an Albino Rhoa Feather?
This rare currency item was originally obtainable by killing the rare Albino Rhoa* located in the Mud Flats.  Since these humble beginnings the feather can also be found in a Perandus Tacklebox, as a result of the gilded fossil, a potential drop from a Tormented Illegal Fisherman, and from The Fishmonger divination card.

# Has a specific recipe been tested?
Welcome to the Fishyard!  Best wishes in all of your testing, the Fishcord Discord testing channel can be used to log your attempts.

# What information should I consider; lore, items, previews, media?
Yes…  This is up to you.  Consider what calls to you the most.  Pick a source type and have fun.  Want to look into all text instances of “fish” or “fishing” in the lore?  Or check the preview/teaser videos for the equiped or inventory items?  Find something interesting and get involved, but most of all have fun.

# What information should I trust; Fishcord, subreddit, wiki, forums, poedb?
Trust, but verify.  Good sources of information should provide enough citations and methods to repeat the process.  We strive to provide additional information for all of our tests.  Most of this information comes from within our ranks.  The wiki can be freely edited, and GGG is known for obscuring some information in their code to prevent data-mining efforts.  Be aware of these elements when you look into any fishing information.
