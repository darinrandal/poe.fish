# [*color*]*_herring* tags
Soon after the release of 3.12.0 Heist league GGG updates tags on various items and modifiers. One type of those modifiers are now known as *_herring* tags. There are three in total *_herring* tags, each corresponding to a different color - *red_herring*, *blue_herring* and *green_herring*. Due to their tag names (and one of the Krillson's missions being *Catch 2 Red Herrings*), items with these mods are commonly refered to *fishing related* items.

# Purpose
So far, no specific use of these tags have been noticed. However, a significant number of fishing item drops occured in zones or by players containing at least one of these *_herring* tags. For example, out of 4 documented Replica Baited Breath drops in Heist, 2 of those occured in an *of Miring* blueprint, which has *blue_herring* tag.

While this is relationship is speculatory at best, it is a good idea to note all fishing-related items a player has during rare fishing event.
